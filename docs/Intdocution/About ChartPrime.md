### Why ChartPrime?

When looking for any premium service in the technical indicator industry; there are two main things that should be looked for: Do the developers build top quality tools and do the team actually trade with their indicators?
In ChartPrime’s case:

- Our team consists of Computer Science graduates, Digital Signal Processing experts and traders. All the team has a very strong academic background. We are one of the largest open source creators on the TradingView platform; contributing to the ecosystem via our abilities.
- Our team host live trading sessions where they use the tools, trade with the community and show results. No facades, no just selling indicators; we really do use our tools.

### Our mission

**Our mission is simple**. Help as many people as possible become winners in the market. ChartPrime indicators are not a miracle cure to poor trading however via our feedback, reviews and supporting data it is clear to see they can massively help.

**Our trading community** is one of the largest on Discord so whether a solo trader or someone that likes to be part of something bigger; we have it all.

**Will our indicators make you money?** We of course do not print money at ChartPrime. For us to claim “yes” these will make you rich would be deceptive.

**We believe the value of our indicators** lies in their interoperability and their ability to make your charts clearer and more useable with unique cutting edge methodologies .
