In order to help a trader visualize trends more clearly; we provide two main unique candle colouring techniques. The first being Trend Gradient.

Trend gradient applies a gradient color to the bars ranging from green _(in an uptrend)_ to red _(in a downtrend)_

A strong green color would imply the market is heavily up trending; a more mild green/purple would suggest the market is weaker or ranging. A strong red color would suggest the market is heavily downtrending and a more mild red/purple would suggest a weaker trend or again; a ranging market.

The disadvantage of the gradient mode is that there are no distinct boundaries making it harder to use for rule based trading.

:::info Therefore
We have also provided trend static candle colouring. This simply colours the candles green in an uptrend and red in a downtrend.
