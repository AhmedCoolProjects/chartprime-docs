Dynamic Reactor
The Dynamic Reactor provides a simple band passing through the chart. This can provide assistance in support and resistance locations as well as identifying the trend direction expressed via green and red colors. Taking a moving average and applying unique adaptivity calculations gives this plot a unique and fast behaviour.

This can be viewed as the center point of the market. It acts as a magnet. The further price moves or deviates away from this area; the stronger it is pulled back to it.

Volume Flex reactor
The Volume Flex Reactor, similar to the dynamic reactor provides a simple band passing through the chart. This reactor however analyses volume and gets wider during volatile times.

The Prime Trend Assistant
The Prime Trend Assistant provides another trend following dynamic support and resistance level. This makes it perfect to use in confluence or as a filter for other supporting indicators. On the chart you will see a green and red line. The red line appears when the market is deemed to be in a downtrend and the green line appears when the market is deemed to be in an uptrend.

As previously mentioned; the price can bounce off these levels and it acts as a support or resistance.
In addition; this indicator makes a wonderful trend following tool. It’s extremely responsive to price action and can be used in confluence with other trend following tools.

Momentum Wave Bands
The momentum wave bands provide areas of highly likely reversals to occur by analysing market momentum and noise. They can be used classically and are comparable in application to the commonly used bollinger bands. When price finds itself inside a zone it is more likely to reverse. This is excellent when used in confluence with other reversal indicators.

The zone is also highlighted with green or red reflecting the nature of the trend.

The wave bands are made up of two zones; the inner and outer. The outer zone has a statistically more likely change of seeing price reverse as it is of a higher deviation.

Candlestick structures
Candlestick structures analyze candlestick formation putting a spin on classical candlestick patterns and provide the most relevant formations on the chart. These are not classical and are filtered by further analyzing market activity. A trader's classic with a spin.
These are superb at reversal identification and are commonly used in confluence with other reversal techniques such as SR confluence. E.g. If price is in resistance + bearish candlestick pattern.

The ChartPrime Dashboard
The ChartPrime dashboard’s aim is to give market insights with just a glance. It is comprised of 3 main items (when enabled in settings).

1. The Optimal Tuning: This setting provides the optimal setting over 500 bars of data allowing for the user to clean a chart’s signals quickly and tune it to the specific timeframe and asset.
2. The Prime Score: Here; we have generated a score from 1-10 on how bullish or bearish the market is. 1 being extremely bearish and 10 being extremely bullish. At a glance a trader can get an insight into the market conditions using an amalgamation of our indicators.
3. The Consolidation Score shows “how ranging” or consolidating the market is on a scale of 1-10. 1 being a heavily trending market and 10 being a ranging market. This can be used to determine optimal trading strategies or whether to avoid trading all together.

The user is able to change the size and location of the dashboard in the settings.
