Signals optimisation and finding the best settings with ChartPrime’s signals is made easy via the Optimal Settings in the dashboard. This is found in the lower right corner of your screen.

Here you will find a single value. This is a mini-backtest result ran by our software. This value can be taken and input into the Tuning area of the settings in order to have an optimal charting and signals experience.

As the markets move; naturally the optimal value will change. We suggest you update this in set intervals.

:::info Alternatively
If you don’t like playing with the settings; we have the auto maximiser option. The ChartPrime Auto Maximizer will automatically apply a backtested parameter and display the "**best performing signals**" on your chart. You can select between high frequency and low frequency signals here. High frequency results in more frequent signals; low frequency results in fewer signals in an attempt to put an emphasis on larger market moves.
