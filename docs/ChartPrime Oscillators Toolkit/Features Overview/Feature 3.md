This brand new oscillator analyses market volatility and produces a blue and purple ribbon.

Blue indicates an uptrend and purple a downtrend. This plot can be used classically and a user can easily use this for divergence identification.

The main other component here is the overextended green bars that appear when a market reversal is due.

When the green bars appear the user can infer that the market may bounce around this region making it once again excellent when used in confluence with other tools from ChartPrime.
