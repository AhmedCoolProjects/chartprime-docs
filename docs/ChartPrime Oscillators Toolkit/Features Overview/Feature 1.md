One of ChartPrimeâ€™s most iconic oscillators; this oscillator uses an amalgamation of **price** and **volume** to give market participants useful insight into possible future price action. It is designed in the format of a classical oscillator to be recogniseable and have a **easy learning curve**.
It is made up of multiple components that are covered below:

## 1. Trend mode

The price volume oscillator uses an adaptive calculation to signify when price is entering a downtrend or and uptrend. When the price volume oscillator intersects with the adaptive plot the color of the price volume band will change to signify an uptrend or a down trend. Green being an uptrend and red being a downtrend.

## 2. Divergences

When the price volume oscillator ribbon peaks and valleys are diverging with price action a thin line will connect the two diverging peaks or vallyes to indicate to market participants that there is a higher probability of a reversal. Divergences can be used in a classical fashion for trading.

There are two main types of divergence (excluding hidden): bullish and bearish divergences. A red line connecting two peaks suggests the price might reverse shortly and a green line connecting two bottoms may suggest the price might bounce upwards in the near future.

## 3. Areas of reversal

These signals incorporate an algorithm that takes the median length of the assets trends, average true range, price deviation, volatility, and gap conditions, to signal areas with high a probability of reversal. Reversal signals are self explanatory and are very useful when used in confluence with other factors.
